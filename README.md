# word shooter

## what it does
it's a simple typing game where you need to type up the word on the screen as fast as you can so they disappear

## why i made it
i wanted to see the capabilities of react in terms of games and i wanted to see if it was able to publish react games on itch.io

## how i made it
i used react, a javascript framework, and i used tailwind, a css library to help me with styling efficiently

## what i struggled with and what i learnt
i struggled with positioning the words on the screen, since i'm not used to using tailwind for games, but now i feel that i've gotten better at using tailwind
